# Overview

I created a tax calculator using Kotlin and Android Studio.

The application basically takes user input (annual income), asks the user to select a tax bracket based on the income, and provides a button that calculates the annual taxes that they will pay.

This project was to help me learn the basics of designing and developing mobile applications on android devices, and to strengthen my  knowledge in Kotlin.

A video demo of my application is in the link here:
